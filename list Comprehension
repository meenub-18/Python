#List Comprehension Methods

Example 1) #Adding two no.s in marks
marks =  [90,96,97,98,99]
new_marks = []
for x in marks:
    new_marks.append(x+2)
# print(new_marks)

#Using List comprehension
marks =  [90,96,97,98,99]
new_marks = [x+2 for x in marks]  #Tip: adding x=2 for x. Where?, In  x
# print(new_marks)

Example 2) #To find the cube of even numbers
cubes = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        cubes.append(x**3)
# print("using for loop:", cubes)

# By using list comprehension.
new_cubes = [x**3 for x in range(10)if x % 2 == 0]
print("Using list comprehension",new_cubes)



Example 3) #Creating a list of 50 no's divisible by 2
list = []
for a in range(1,51):  
    if a % 2 == 0:
      list.append(a)
print(list)

#Using List comprehension
l = [a for a in range(1,51) if a%2==0]   #Print the  values that are divisible by two.(even no's)
print(l)

Example 3) #Converting string into list using list comprehension (string element storing in list)
new = "marvelous"
list = [a for a in new]
print(list)  

Example 4) #print the list divisible by 3 
list = [] 
for a in range(1,101):
    if a%3==0:
        list.append(a)    
print(list)

#using list comprehension
l = [a for a in range(1,101) if a%3==0]   #(range = n-1)
print(l)

#Dictionary Comprehension Methods

Example 1) Creating dictionary with items 1 to 100
dict1 = {i :f"item {i}" for i in range(1, 101)}
print(dict1)

Example 2) Creating Dictionary with items 1 to 100 with condition (nos divisible by 10)
dict2 = {i :f"item {i}" for i in range(1, 101) if i%10==0}
print(dict2)
